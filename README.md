1. Omelette
    1. Heat up the stove. Crack 10 **eggs** and put 2 **yolks** and the **whites** in a bowl. Add salt and stir.
     
    2. Put some **butter** (10 grams) in the pan and spread evenly over the surface. It should melt in a jiffy if you turn on the stove before cracking the eggs.
     
    3. Pour the egg whites in the pan and wait.
     
    4. Shortly before the omelette is ready, add 250 grams of **cottage cheese** and watch it melt into the omelette.

2. Fish & Brcolli:
    1. Cook or prepare 250 grams of **broccoli** or **cauliflower**.
     
    2. Put some butter (10 grams) in the pan and prepare 400 grams of **sirloin steak** / maybe I will use **fish**.
     
    3. Finish off your meal with a large **apple, pear, or orange**.

3. Chicken Breast: [pictures](https://kuancaipu.com/index/food/detail/id/295.html)
    1. 400 grams of **chicken breast**
    2. Marinate with **生抽酱油, 老抽, egg whites, oil**, or really with any type of seasoning
    3. Stir fry with **scallion, ginger, soy bean sauce**


4. Salad:
    1. **Grilled chicken breast**
    2. **Spinash, lettuce**
    3. Dressing: **balsamic vinegars**

Shakes:

1. Protein Fluff
   1. Thaw 250 grams of **frozen strawberries** in a microwave for 45 to 60 seconds.
   2. Put the strawberries in a big bowl together with a scoop (35 grams) of **casein powder** and 1 deciliter (3.4 ounces) of **skim milk** (0.1 to 0.5 percent fat). Add sweetener; I prefer 1 tablespoon of granulated aspartame. Mash everything together.
   3. Use an electric mixer and whisk for 5 to 10 minutes. The longer you whisk, the bigger the fluff.
   4. Enjoy alone, or coupled with **sliced banana** and/or anything else that tickles your taste buds. You can also eat it with **cottage cheese**.
